Terraform module for managing **Proxmox SDN** (Software-Defined Networking) with optional **host L3**, **SNAT**, and **per-subnet DHCP via dnsmasq**.

Use it when you want Proxmox networking to be **rebuildable and source-controlled** rather than manually recreated after every lab reset, host replacement, or environment rollout.

It creates a VLAN-backed SDN zone, VNets, and subnets on **Proxmox VE 8.x** and can:

- Configure **gateway IPs** on VNet bridge interfaces (host L3).
- Add **SNAT / masquerade** rules per subnet.
- Provision **dnsmasq DHCP** pools per subnet.
- Emit a **NetBox-ready IPAM export payload** (prefixes + DHCP metadata).

The two practical operating modes are:

- **Host-routed**: Proxmox owns the gateway IPs, NAT, and optional DHCP. Good for serious labs, bootstrap, and smaller sites.
- **Edge-routed**: Proxmox SDN provides segmentation, while a real edge appliance such as VyOS owns routing and DHCP.

Designed for **production-style Proxmox platforms** and advanced labs, and usable:

- As **standalone Terraform** in a focused project, advanced lab, or production stack.
- As part of a **Terragrunt / monorepo stack** (for example, within a HybridOps `live-v1` layout).

## Quick start

### Minimal example (Terraform Registry / standalone)

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5.0"

  required_providers {
    proxmox = {
      source  = "bpg/proxmox"
      version = ">= 0.50.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint  = var.proxmox_url
  api_token = var.proxmox_token
  insecure  = var.proxmox_insecure
}

module "sdn" {
  source  = "hybridops-tech/sdn/proxmox"
  version = "~> 0.1.5"

  # SDN zone ID must follow Proxmox SDN rules (<= 8 chars, no dashes)
  zone_name    = "hybzone"
  proxmox_node = var.proxmox_node
  proxmox_host = var.proxmox_host

  # Optional host L3 and SNAT
  enable_host_l3   = true
  enable_snat      = true
  uplink_interface = "vmbr0"

  # Optional DHCP (requires enable_host_l3 = true)
  enable_dhcp = true
  dns_domain  = "hybridops.local"
  dns_lease   = "24h"
  # Optional: force one host-side reconcile when recovering from drift
  # (gateway/NAT/DHCP) without changing topology inputs.
  # host_reconcile_nonce = "CHG-20260225-01"

  vnets = {
    vnetmgmt = {
      vlan_id     = 10
      description = "Management Network"

      subnets = {
        mgmt = {
          cidr    = "10.10.0.0/24"
          gateway = "10.10.0.1"

          # DHCP is opt-out at subnet level when enable_dhcp = true:
          # - omit dhcp_enabled to use module defaults (enabled with default ranges), or
          # - set dhcp_enabled = false to disable DHCP for this subnet.
          dhcp_enabled     = true
          dhcp_range_start = "10.10.0.100"
          dhcp_range_end   = "10.10.0.200"
          dhcp_dns_server  = "8.8.8.8"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Example variables (API + node details):

```hcl
# Proxmox API configuration
proxmox_url      = "https://<PROXMOX-IP>:8006/api2/json"
proxmox_token    = "user@pam!tokenid=<YOUR-API-TOKEN-SECRET>"
proxmox_insecure = true

# Proxmox node configuration
proxmox_node = "<PROXMOX-NODE-NAME>"
proxmox_host = "<PROXMOX-IP>"
```

### GitHub source (monorepos / explicit tag pinning)

For monorepos or Terragrunt-based stacks, you can pin a specific tag directly
from GitHub when you do not want to consume the registry release path:

```hcl
module "sdn" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/hybridops-tech/terraform-proxmox-sdn.git//?ref=v0.1.5"
}
```

In Terragrunt, this is typically wrapped via `terraform { source = "..." }` and `inputs = { ... }` in a stack directory such as:

```text
hybridops-platform/infra/terraform/live-v1/onprem/proxmox/core/00-foundation/network-sdn/
```

## Features

- Creates a VLAN-backed **SDN zone** on a Proxmox bridge.
- Manages **VNets** and **subnets** via a single `vnets` map.
- Optional **host L3**: assigns gateway IPs on VNet bridge interfaces.
- Optional **SNAT**: per-subnet masquerade to an uplink interface.
- Optional **dnsmasq DHCP**: per-subnet DHCP pools, driven from Terraform state.
- Exposes **NetBox IPAM export payload** via `output.ipam_prefixes`.
- Designed to be **idempotent** and safe to re-apply.

Typical reference layout (six VLANs):

- Environments: `mgmt`, `obs`, `dev`, `staging`, `prod`, `lab`.
- For `/24` subnets:
  - `.1` – gateway (VNet bridge).
  - `.2–.9` – infrastructure services.
  - `.10–.119` – static IPs (IPAM / NetBox).
  - `.120–.220` – DHCP pool.
  - `.221–.254` – reserved.

---

## Requirements

- Proxmox VE **8.x** with SDN enabled.
- VLAN-aware bridge (for example `vmbr0`).
- `dnsmasq` installed on the Proxmox node (if using DHCP).
- Terraform **>= 1.5.0**.
- Provider **bpg/proxmox >= 0.50.0**.
- SSH access from the runner to the Proxmox node for host-side configuration (L3 / SNAT / DHCP).

## Inputs

### Core inputs

| Name           | Type   | Required | Description |
|----------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| `zone_name`    | string | yes      | SDN zone ID (≤ 8 chars, lowercase, no dashes – Proxmox SDN rules). |
| `zone_bridge`  | string | no       | Proxmox bridge to attach the SDN zone to (default: `vmbr0`). |
| `proxmox_node` | string | yes      | Proxmox node name (for example `pve` or `hybridhub`). |
| `proxmox_host` | string | yes      | Proxmox host (IP or DNS) used over SSH for host-side scripts. |
| `vnets`        | map    | yes      | Map of VNets and subnets (see structure below). |

### Host L3 / SNAT / DHCP toggles

| Name               | Type   | Default | Description |
|--------------------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_host_l3`   | bool   | `true`  | Configure VNet gateway IPs on the host (required for SNAT and DHCP). |
| `enable_snat`      | bool   | `true`  | Enable SNAT/masquerade for SDN subnets via `uplink_interface`. |
| `uplink_interface` | string | `vmbr0` | Uplink interface used for SNAT (typically the WAN/LAN bridge). |
| `enable_dhcp`      | bool   | `false` | Enable dnsmasq DHCP provisioning (requires `enable_host_l3 = true`). |
| `dns_domain`       | string | `hybridops.local` | DNS domain used in dnsmasq config. |
| `dns_lease`        | string | `24h`   | DHCP lease time (`<number><s|m|h|d>`, e.g. `24h`). |
| `host_reconcile_nonce` | string | `""` | Optional operator token to force host-side SDN reconciliation (gateway/NAT/DHCP) on the next apply, even when topology inputs are unchanged. |
| `host_static_routes` | list(object) | `[]` | Optional static routes installed on the Proxmox host when it owns the guest gateway role. |

> The module enforces that `enable_dhcp = true` requires `enable_host_l3 = true`, so dnsmasq can bind to VNet interfaces safely.
>
> `host_static_routes` also requires `enable_host_l3 = true`, because the Proxmox host must be the effective gateway for guests before these routes can influence downstream traffic.

### Recovery / self-heal (host-side drift)

If host-side SDN state drifts (for example a `vnet*` bridge exists but the
expected gateway IP is missing) and topology inputs are unchanged, rerun
`terraform apply` with a one-time `host_reconcile_nonce` value to force the
host-side gateway/NAT/DHCP setup scripts to re-run:

```hcl
host_reconcile_nonce = "CHG-20260225-01"
```

This is the supported recovery path. Avoid changing unrelated settings (for
example `dns_lease`) just to trigger reconciliation.

### Optional upstream/cloud route handoff

When the Proxmox host is running in host-routed mode but a separate on-prem edge
owns cloud or WAN reachability, install explicit prefixes on the Proxmox host:

```hcl
host_static_routes = [
  {
    destination_cidr = "10.72.0.0/20"
    next_hop         = "10.10.0.20"
  },
  {
    destination_cidr = "10.72.16.0/20"
    next_hop         = "10.10.0.20"
  },
  {
    destination_cidr = "10.74.0.0/18"
    next_hop         = "10.10.0.20"
  },
]
```

This is the supported model for site-extension or edge-anchor designs where:
- guests still use the Proxmox host as their default gateway
- the separate edge/router is the owner of upstream cloud prefixes

For greenfield sites, or where guest gateway ownership can be moved safely,
prefer the edge-routed model instead of extending host-routed mode with static
route handoff.

### VNet structure

Each VNet key must be a valid Proxmox SDN identifier (≤ 8 chars, no dashes).

```hcl
vnets = {
  vnetmgmt = {
    vlan_id     = number
    description = string

    subnets = {
      subnet_name = {
        cidr    = string
        gateway = string

        # DHCP configuration:
        # - enable_dhcp must be true (module-level)
        # - dhcp_enabled is optional (subnet-level)
        #
        # Behaviour when enable_dhcp = true:
        # - dhcp_enabled omitted -> DHCP enabled using defaults (start/end/DNS), unless you override.
        # - dhcp_enabled = false -> DHCP disabled for that subnet.
        dhcp_enabled     = optional(bool)
        dhcp_range_start = optional(string)  # defaults to cidrhost(cidr, dhcp_default_start_host)
        dhcp_range_end   = optional(string)  # defaults to cidrhost(cidr, dhcp_default_end_host)
        dhcp_dns_server  = optional(string)  # defaults to dhcp_default_dns_server
      }
    }
  }

  # additional VNets...
}
```

---

## Outputs

| Name           | Type | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| `zone_name`    | string | SDN zone name (Proxmox SDN zone ID). |
| `vnets`        | map    | Map of VNet keys to objects with `id`, `zone`, and `vlan_id`. |
| `subnets`      | map    | Map of subnet keys (`<vnet>-<subnet>`) to objects with CIDR, gateway, and DHCP metadata (effective values). |
| `ipam_prefixes`| list   | NetBox IPAM dataset derived from SDN inputs (prefixes + DHCP metadata). |

### Example: inspecting outputs

After `terraform apply`:

```bash
terraform output zone_name
terraform output vnets
terraform output subnets
terraform output -json ipam_prefixes
```

Example `ipam_prefixes` item (shape):

```hcl
{
  site         = "onprem-hybridhub"
  status       = "active"
  vlan_id      = 10
  role         = "management"
  prefix       = "10.10.0.0/24"
  gateway      = "10.10.0.1"
  dhcp_enabled = true
  dhcp_start   = "10.10.0.120"
  dhcp_end     = "10.10.0.220"
  description  = "Management network (static .2-.119; DHCP .120-.220)"
}
```

This output is designed to be consumed by downstream tooling (for example, NetBox seeders) without maintaining a separate IPAM CSV.

## DHCP behaviour

- DHCP is provided by **dnsmasq** on the Proxmox node, driven from the `vnets` map.
- DHCP is controlled at two levels:
  - Module-level: `enable_dhcp = true` enables DHCP orchestration.
  - Subnet-level: `dhcp_enabled` is an opt-out when `enable_dhcp = true`.
- When DHCP is enabled for a subnet and explicit ranges are not provided, the module derives defaults from:
  - `dhcp_default_start_host`
  - `dhcp_default_end_host`
  - `dhcp_default_dns_server`
- When `enable_dhcp = false`, no dnsmasq configuration is rendered and no DHCP systemd units are managed.
- When `enable_host_l3 = true` but `enable_dhcp = false`, you still get:
  - VNet bridge interfaces with gateway IPs.
  - Optional SNAT rules, so subnets can reach the internet with static IPs only.

## Deployment modes

The module supports two valid operating patterns:

### 1. Host-routed mode

Use this for:
- bootstrap foundations
- academy/lab environments
- single-node or small-site deployments where Proxmox can safely provide L3/NAT/DHCP

Typical settings:

```hcl
enable_host_l3 = true
enable_snat    = true
enable_dhcp    = true
```

In this mode the Proxmox node owns:
- subnet gateway IPs on `vnet*`
- optional SNAT via the chosen uplink
- optional dnsmasq-based DHCP
- optional `host_static_routes` for selected upstream or cloud prefixes

### 2. Edge-routed mode

Use this for:
- production platforms with a dedicated edge/router appliance
- HybridOps WAN edge / VyOS designs
- environments where north-south routing should not be handled by the hypervisor

Typical settings:

```hcl
enable_host_l3 = false
enable_snat    = false
enable_dhcp    = false
```

In this mode Proxmox SDN provides:
- VLAN-backed segmentation
- VNet and subnet object management

and routing/DHCP are delegated to the actual edge or network services layer.

Recommended production posture:
- let **VyOS or the edge tier** own north-south routing and egress
- keep Proxmox SDN focused on segmentation unless you explicitly want host-routed subnets

## Brownfield adoption

If a site already has manually created Proxmox SDN objects, do **not** assume this
module can safely take them over just by using the same names.

Safe options are:
- create a **new zone/VNet set** managed only by this module, or
- perform a deliberate **import/cutover** into Terraform state before treating
  the module as the source of truth

Unsafe pattern:
- pointing the module at an existing manually managed zone/VNet set without an
  import plan, then expecting `destroy` to distinguish operator-created objects
  from module-managed ones

The module is safe when it is the authoritative owner of the SDN objects in its
Terraform state.

## Destroy scope

`terraform destroy` / `hyops destroy` is **zone-scoped**, not a blanket Proxmox
network wipe.

What it removes for the zone in its own state:
- the SDN zone/VNet/subnet objects managed by the module
- gateway addresses derived from that zone's gateway state files
- NAT rules tagged for that zone
- dnsmasq DHCP units/configs matching that zone name

What it does **not** intentionally remove:
- unrelated Proxmox bridges and manual Linux networking outside the zone
- NAT rules not tagged with the module's comment format
- DHCP units/configs for other zones
- unrelated SDN zones not in this Terraform state

Destroy is still disruptive for the zone it manages, so reserve it for:
- lab teardown
- controlled rebuilds
- deliberate decommission of a module-owned SDN segment

---

## Known limitations

- SDN zone and VNet IDs must follow **Proxmox SDN naming rules** (≤ 8 chars, no dashes).
- After `destroy`, VNet bridge interfaces may persist until networking is reloaded (`ifreload -a` / `pvesh set /cluster/sdn`).
- `dnsmasq` is the only supported DHCP engine.
- On older releases, Proxmox UI may show SDN status warnings even when traffic
  flows correctly if host L3 gateway addresses were attached outside the
  generated SDN interface file. Current releases normalise the generated
  `vnet*` stanzas to `inet static` with the derived gateway address so UI
  status aligns with the running host state.
